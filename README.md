# News app based on NewsAPI
For Tech Interview challenge

# Notes:

The News app uses the NewsAPI to fetch news articles using the [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org).

The app populates with articles from the **[Top Headlines](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/top-headlines)**-endpoint endpoint by default and whenever the search query is empty.

Use the search field in the top to search for articles using query. Searching using a query uses the **[Everything](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything)**-endpoint.

The app uses pagination and _infinite scroll_ to load only 5 articles at a time. To view more articles, just scroll down.

***Note: The API Key used in this demo app is exposed and likely is out of free API requests. Use your own if needed or get one [here](https://newsapi.org/register).***
