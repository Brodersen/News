# News app based on NewsAPI
App Project developed for a Tech Interview challenge.

## Features

This app uses the NewsAPI to fetch various articles using [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org).

The app news screen is initially populated with articles from the **[Top Headlines](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/top-headlines)**-endpoint and whenever the search query is reset (is empty).

Use the search field in the top bar to search for articles by typing a query. Searching articles uses the **[Everything](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything)**-endpoint.

The app features pagination and _infinite scroll_ to load five articles at a time. Scrolling down the list loads the next five articles.

***Note: The API Key used in this demo app is exposed and likely is out of free API requests. Use your own if needed or get one [here](https://newsapi.org/register).***
